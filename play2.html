    <h6 class="name">LORD ILLINGWORTH.</h6><p class="lord_illingworth speech"> Ah! she is not modern, and to be modern is the only
    thing worth being nowadays.  You want to be modern, don’t you, Gerald?
    You want to know life as it really is.  Not to be put off with any
    old-fashioned theories about life.  Well, what you have to do at present
    is simply to fit yourself for the best society.  A man who can dominate a
    London dinner-table can dominate the world.  The future belongs to the
    dandy.  It is the exquisites who are going to rule.</p>
    
    <h6 class="name">GERALD.</h6><p class= "gerald speech">I should like to wear nice things awfully, but I have always
    been told that a man should not think too much about his clothes.</p>
    
    <h6 class="name">LORD ILLINGWORTH.</h6><p class="lord_illingworth speech"> People nowadays are so absolutely superficial that
    they don’t understand the philosophy of the superficial.  By the way,
    Gerald, you should learn how to tie your tie better.  Sentiment is all
    very well for the button-hole.  But the essential thing for a necktie is
    style.  A well-tied tie is the first serious step in life. </p>
