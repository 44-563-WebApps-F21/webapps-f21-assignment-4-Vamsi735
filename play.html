    <h4>ACT III.  _The Hall at Hunstanton Chase_.</h4>
    <p> _The Picture Gallery at Hunstanton_.  _Door at back leading on to
        terrace_.</p><br>
    <p class="stage-direction">[LORD ILLINGWORTH _and_ GERALD, R.C.  LORD ILLINGWORTH _lolling on a
sofa_.  GERALD _in a chair_.]</p><br>

<p><h6 class="name">LORD ILLINGWORTH.</h6></p><p class="lord_illingworth speech">Thoroughly sensible woman, your mother, Gerald.  I
knew she would come round in the end.</p><br>

<p><h6 class="name">GERALD.</h6></p><p class= "gerald speech">My mother is awfully conscientious, Lord Illingworth, and I know
she doesn’t think I am educated enough to be your secretary.  She is
perfectly right, too.  I was fearfully idle when I was at school, and I
couldn’t pass an examination now to save my life.</p><br>

<h6 class="name">LORD ILLINGWORTH.</h6><p class="lord_illingworth speech"> My dear Gerald, examinations are of no value
whatsoever.  If a man is a gentleman, he knows quite enough, and if he is
not a gentleman, whatever he knows is bad for him.</p><br>

<h6 class="name">GERALD.</h6><p class= "gerald speech"> But I am so ignorant of the world, Lord Illingworth.</p><br>

<h6 class="name">LORD ILLINGWORTH.</h6><p class="lord_illingworth speech">Don’t be afraid, Gerald.  Remember that you’ve got on
your side the most wonderful thing in the world—youth!  There is nothing
like youth.  The middle-aged are mortgaged to Life.  The old are in
life’s lumber-room.  But youth is the Lord of Life.  Youth has a kingdom
waiting for it.  Every one is born a king, and most people die in exile,
like most kings.  To win back my youth, Gerald, there is nothing I
wouldn’t do—except take exercise, get up early, or be a useful member of
the community.</p><br>

<h6 class="name">GERALD.</h6><p class= "gerald speech">But you don’t call yourself old, Lord Illingworth?</p><br>

<h6 class="name">LORD ILLINGWORTH.</h6><p class="lord_illingworth speech">I am old enough to be your father, Gerald.</p><br>

<h6 class="name">GERALD.</h6><p class= "gerald speech">I don’t remember my father; he died years ago.</p><br>

<h6 class="name">LORD ILLINGWORTH.</h6><p class="lord_illingworth speech">So Lady Hunstanton told me.</p><br>

<h6 class="name">GERALD.</h6><p class= "gerald speech">It is very curious, my mother never talks to me about my father.
I sometimes think she must have married beneath her.</p><br>

<h6 class="name">LORD ILLINGWORTH.</h6><p class="lord_illingworth speech">[_Winces slightly_.]  Really?  [_Goes over and puts
his hand on_ GERALD’S _shoulder_.]  You have missed not having a father,
I suppose, Gerald?</p><br>

<h6 class="name">GERALD.</h6><p class= "gerald speech"> Oh, no; my mother has been so good to me.  No one ever had such
a mother as I have had.</p><br>

<h6 class="name">LORD ILLINGWORTH.</h6><p class="lord_illingworth speech"> I am quite sure of that.  Still I should imagine that
most mothers don’t quite understand their sons.  Don’t realise, I mean,
that a son has ambitions, a desire to see life, to make himself a name.
After all, Gerald, you couldn’t be expected to pass all your life in such
a hole as Wrockley, could you?</p><br>

<h6 class="name">GERALD.</h6><p class= "gerald speech">Oh, no!  It would be dreadful!</p><br>

<h6 class="name">LORD ILLINGWORTH.</h6><p class="lord_illingworth speech">A mother’s love is very touching, of course, but it is
often curiously selfish.  I mean, there is a good deal of selfishness in
it.</p><br>

<h6 class="name">GERALD.</h6><p class= "gerald speech">[_Slowly_.]  I suppose there is.</p><br>

<h6 class="name">LORD ILLINGWORTH.</h6><p class="lord_illingworth speech">Your mother is a thoroughly good woman.  But good
women have such limited views of life, their horizon is so small, their
interests are so petty, aren’t they?</p><br>

<h6 class="name">GERALD.</h6><p class= "gerald speech">They are awfully interested, certainly, in things we don’t care
much about.</p><br>

<h6 class="name">LORD ILLINGWORTH.</h6><p class="lord_illingworth speech">I suppose your mother is very religious, and that sort
of thing.</p><br>

<h6 class="name">GERALD.</h6><p class= "gerald speech"> Oh, yes, she’s always going to church.</p>
